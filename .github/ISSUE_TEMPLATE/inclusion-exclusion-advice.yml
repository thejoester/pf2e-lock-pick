        Thanks! This form helps us recommend **what to include/exclude** in presets and exports.
        - Avoid sharing secrets (API keys, license keys).
        - If possible, include screenshots of relevant settings pages.
        - BBMM avoids auto-saving live “state” data to prevent overwriting active sessions; we’ll focus on stable **configuration**.
